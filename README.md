# Image-Based Episode Recognition from Unlabeled or Poorly Named Video Content

This project demonstrates a computer vision system for identifying and labeling video episodes based on visual similarity to known reference images (e.g., thumbnails). The goal is to automate metadata recovery and organization for large media collections with incomplete or missing episode information.

**Note on Ethics and Legality:**
- This project is designed and documented using only public domain or open-access video content (e.g., Internet Archive, Creative Commons, or public domain TV shows/films).
- No proprietary or copyrighted assets are included or referenced.
- The system is intended for research, archival, and metadata recovery purposes â€” not for circumventing copyright protections or distributing copyrighted material.

## Project Overview
- **Input:**
  - Video files (e.g., .mkv) with unknown or partial episode content (public domain or open-access only)
  - Reference images (thumbnails) for each episode (from open sources)
- **Output:**
  - The best-matching episode name and number for each video file or segment

## How It Works
1. **Frame Extraction:**
   - Samples frames from each video file at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds).
2. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocesses both video frames and thumbnails (resize, grayscale, etc.) for robust comparison.
3. **Image Matching:**
   - Compares each sampled frame to the set of thumbnails using a fast image similarity method (e.g., perceptual hash, CLIP, or feature matching).
   - Selects the reference image with the highest match score.
   - Works even if only a portion of the episode is available, as long as it includes or resembles the thumbnail.
4. **Result Reporting:**
   - Outputs the episode name and number for each video file or segment.

## Extensibility
- Swap in advanced similarity methods (deep learning, etc.)
- Use multiple reference images per episode for improved accuracy
- Apply to other domains beyond TV episodes (movies, games, etc.)
- Return a confidence score
- Rename / Generate metadata for files automatically

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV (for image and video processing)
- NumPy
- (Optional) scikit-image, deep learning libraries for advanced matching

## Getting Started
1. Place your public domain or open-access video files and reference images in accessible folders.
2. Run the main script (to be developed) and provide paths to the videos and thumbnails.
3. The script will process each video and output the best-matching episode information.

## Potential Extensions
- Automate thumbnail download from open databases (e.g., TMDb, Internet Archive)
- Batch process entire seasons
- Use advanced scene detection or deep learning for improved accuracy
- Support for partial video files or clips
